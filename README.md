Data Management and Visualization :Assignment-week-1
I am interested to work with Gapminder data set
After reviewing the variable i want to wok with the variavle “ lifeexpectancy“, which is 2011 life expectancy at birth (years) as  life expectancy is an important indicator for the development in the health and socio-economic  of a country.
I want to relate the variable “ urbanrate”, which is 2008 urban population (% of total) with the  life expectancy.
 So my hypothesis is “ Whether  life expectancy depends on the urban population?”
I did literature reviews on this 
Literature reviews
It is found that life expectancy was inversely related to levels of rurality. In 2005–2009, those in large metropolitan areas had a life expectancy of 79.1 years, compared with 76.9 years in small urban towns and 76.7 years in rural areas (Singh, G. K., & Siahpush, M. ,2014).  Kyte, L., and  Wells, C. (2010) also established that life expectancy was higher in rural areas than in urban areas.
It is also concluded by Kyte, L., & Wells, C. (2010) that the majority of people now live in urban areas and will do so for the foreseeable future. As a force in the demographic and health transition, urbanization is associated with falling birth and death rates. Thus life expectancy will be more in urban area than rural.
Agricultural Revolution played an important role in human development and life pattern and after that urbanization begun. Galor, O., and Moav, O. (2005) found that the research advances an evolutionary growth theory that captures the pattern of life expectancy in the process of development, shedding new light on the sources of the remarkable rise in life expectancy since the Agricultural Revolution.
On the hand, it is also revealed that the life expectancies for China’s rural and urban populations are more or less the same (Jiang, Z., Zhang, W., and  Zhu, L. , 1986).
From the above reviews it is summarized that life expectancy is directly related with the urbanization. For the selected data it will be revealed the above findings.
